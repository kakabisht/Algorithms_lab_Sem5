[Research paper referenced](http://www.ijcsms.com/journals/Volume%2013,%20Issue%2005,%20July%202013_deeptigrover%20research%20paper.pdf)

Objectives: To use an enhanced merge sort algorithm to sort an array.

Although merge sort is O(n log n) and insertion sort is O(n2), insertion sort has better constants and is thus faster on very small arrays.

Pseudocode / Algorithm:

1.Input size of the vector
2.Input elements in the vector
3.Input the value to be found 
4.If low < high 
    1.Set Mid =(low+high)/2
    2.Divide the array into smaller sizes
    3.One from low to middle
    4.Another one from middle to high
    5.If high -low <= 10 
        1.We use insertion sort to optimize the algorithm
    6.Else
        1.We use merge sort to compare these smaller sized components to sort and merge them
5.We Display the sorted array 
 
Output: 
Best case: O(n )
Worst case: O(n log (n))
Average case: O(n log (n))



3.Quick Sort:

Objectives: To use a quick sort algorithm to sort an array.

Pseudocode / Algorithm:

1.Input size of the vector
2.Input elements in the vector
3.Input the value to be found 
4.Selecting a pivot element 
    1.Moving the elements smaller than pivot to left
    2.Moving the elements greater than pivot to left
    3.Moving the elements equal to the pivot together with pivot
5.We Display the sorted array 
  
 
Output: 
Best case: O(n log (n))
Worst case: O(n log (n))
Average case: O(n *n)

WAP to perform Prim and Kruskal Algorithms.

1.Prim Algorithm

1.Begin
2.Create an edge list of given graph, with their weights.
3.Draw all nodes to create a skeleton for the spanning tree.
4.Select an edge with lowest weight and add it to the skeleton and delete edge from edge list.
5.Add other edges. While adding an edge take care that the one end of the edge should always be in the skeleton tree and its cost should be minimum.
6.Repeat step 5 until n-1 edges are added.
.Return.

Output:
 Since we are using an Adjacency Matrix for storing edges, hence time complexity     will  O(|V|2). 

2.Kruskal Algorithm

1.Begin
2.Create the edge list of the given graph, with their weights.
3.Sort the edge list according to their weights in ascending order.
4.Draw all the nodes to create a skeleton for the spanning tree.
5.Pick up the edge at the top of the edge list (i.e. edge with    minimum weight).
6.Remove this edge from the edge list.
7.Connect the vertices in the skeleton with the given edge. If by connecting the vertices, a cycle is created in the skeleton, then discard this edge.
8.Repeat steps 5 to 7, until n-1 edges are added or the list of edges is over.
9.Return

Output:
Let us assume a graph with e number of edges and n number of vertices. Kruskal’s algorithm starts with sorting edges.
1.Time complexity of sorting algorithm= O (e log e)
2.Time complexity of merging of components= O (e log n)

Overall time complexity of the algorithm= O (e log e) + O (e log n)

Assignment - 4
WAP to perform Dijkstra Algorithms.

Dijkstra Algorithm:
1.Start with the empty Shortest Path Tree (SPT).
2.Maintain a set SPT[] to keep track to vertices included in SPT.
3.Assign a distance value to all the vertices, (say distance []) and initialize all the distances with +∞ (Infinity) except the source vertex. This will be used to keep track of the distance of vertices *from the source vertex. The distance of source vertex to source *vertex will be 0.
4.Repeat the following steps until all vertices are processed.
    1.Pick the vertex u which is not in SPT[] and has minimum distance. Here we will loop through the vertices and find the vertex with minimum distance.
    2.Add vertex u to SPT[].
    3.Loop over all the adjacent vertices of
    4.For adjacent vertex v, if v is not in SPT[] and distance[v] > distance[u] + edge u-v weight then update distance[v] = distance[u] + edge u-v weight
 
Time Complexity: O(|V|2), since we are using a matrix for storing data.
